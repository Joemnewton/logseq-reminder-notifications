## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-14

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- **Automatic block detection** - Plugin now automatically scans for new scheduled blocks every 2 minutes

- **Enhanced logging** - Better console output for debugging and monitoring

### Fixed
- **UI interference resolved** - Removed problematic database listeners that caused invisible text while typing
- **Real-time detection** - No more need for manual `/reminders: rescan` after creating scheduled blocks
- **Performance improvements** - Optimized scanning frequency and debouncing

### Changed
- **Scanning frequency** - Automatic scans every 2 minutes (down from manual-only)
- **Better user experience** - Plugin now "just works" without manual intervention

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-14

### Added
- Desktop and in-app notifications for scheduled blocks

### Technical Details

### Known Limitations
- Only scans blocks within next 7 days
