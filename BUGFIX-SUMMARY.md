# Logseq Reminder Plugin - Fixed Version 1.2.1

## 🔧 Critical Issues Resolved

### 1. ❌ **Settings GUI Not Appearing**
**Fixed**: Settings should now appear properly in Logseq Settings → Plugins → Reminder Notifications

### 2. ❌ **XCode Opening When Clicking "Open Settings"**  
**Fixed**: Removed persistent storage of notification tracking data. The plugin no longer saves state to disk, preventing XCode from opening settings.json files.

### 3. ❌ **Duplicate Notifications for Past Events** 
**Fixed**: Added smart time filtering to prevent notifications for events more than 1 hour in the past. This stops the repeated 7:05 AM notifications you were experiencing.

### 4. ❌ **Repeated Notifications Within Session**
**Fixed**: Improved session-based notification tracking that persists during plugin runtime but doesn't save to disk.

## ✅ What's Working Now

- **Basic Notifications**: Desktop + in-app notifications for scheduled blocks
- **Time Filtering**: Won't notify for significantly past events (>1 hour old)
- **Session Deduplication**: Won't send duplicate notifications during same session
- **Settings GUI**: Should appear in plugin settings (after reload)
- **No Disk Storage**: No more XCode popups when accessing settings

## 📋 Current Settings Available

1. **Lead Time (minutes)**: How many minutes before scheduled time to notify (default: 0)
2. **Check Interval (seconds)**: How often to scan for reminders (default: 30) 
3. **Enable All-Day Block Reminders**: For blocks without specific times (default: false)
4. **All-Day Reminder Hour**: What hour to remind for all-day blocks (default: 9 AM)

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

1. **Reload the Plugin**:
   - Go to Logseq Settings → Plugins
   - Find "Reminder Notifications" 
   - Disable and re-enable it, OR
   - Click the reload button if available

2. **Check Settings GUI**:
   - Go to Settings → Plugins → Reminder Notifications
   - Should show 4 settings options without crashing
   - Should NOT open XCode

3. **Test Future Reminders**:
   ```
   SCHEDULED: <2025-10-14 Mon 16:00> Test reminder for later today
   ```

4. **Verify No Past Notifications**:
   - Should NOT get notifications for the 7:05 AM event anymore
   - Old past events should be ignored

## 🚀 Next Steps

If this version works properly:
- ✅ Settings appear without crashes  
- ✅ No XCode popups
- ✅ No duplicate past notifications
- ✅ Future reminders work correctly

Then we can safely add back advanced features like:
