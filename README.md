## Usage

### Supported Scheduling Formats

The plugin recognizes scheduled blocks in these formats:

#### 1. Journal-style Timestamps (in block content)
```
- SCHEDULED: <2025-10-14 Tue 14:30> Call the dentist
- TODO Buy groceries SCHEDULED: <2025-10-15 Wed 09:00>
```

#### 2. Property-based Scheduling
```
- Call the dentist
  scheduled:: 2025-10-14 14:30
  
- Buy groceries
  scheduled:: 2025-10-15T09:00
```

#### 3. Mixed Formats
```
- Meeting with team SCHEDULED: <2025-10-14 Tue 15:30>
  scheduled:: 2025-10-14 15:30
  notes:: Discuss project timeline
```

### Testing the Plugin

#### Quick Test Setup

1. **Create a test block** with a near-future time:
   ```
   - Test reminder SCHEDULED: <2025-10-14 Mon 16:45>
   ```
   (Replace with current date and a time 2-3 minutes from now)

2. **Enable desktop notifications** when prompted by Logseq

3. **Wait for automatic detection** - the plugin scans every 2 minutes automatically

4. **Get notified** - you'll receive both desktop and in-app notifications at the scheduled time!

#### Manual Control Options

**If you want immediate detection:**
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Press `Cmd+Shift+R` (Mac) or `Ctrl+Shift+R` (Windows/Linux)
- **Slash command**: Type `/reminders: rescan` in any block and press Enter
- **Check console**: Open Developer Tools (F12) → Console tab for detailed logs

### Configuration

Access plugin settings via **Settings** → **Plugins** → **Reminder Notifications**:

- **Lead Time (minutes)**: Show notifications X minutes before scheduled time (default: 0)
- **Check Interval (seconds)**: How often to check for due reminders (default: 30, range: 10-300)
- **Daily Rescan Hour**: Hour of day for automatic rescan in 24h format (default: 3, range: 0-23)

### Console Logging

The plugin provides detailed console logging for debugging:
- Open browser dev tools (F12) → Console tab
- Look for messages prefixed with 🔔, 📅, 🔍, etc.
- Scan results show found reminders and their scheduled times

## Limitations and Known Issues

### Current Limitations

1. **Date-only schedules ignored**: Blocks with `SCHEDULED: <2025-10-14>` (no time) won't trigger notifications
2. **Next 7 days only**: Only scans for reminders within the next week to avoid performance issues
3. **Local timezone only**: Uses system timezone, no custom timezone support
4. **Desktop permission required**: Desktop notifications need browser permission
5. **Memory-based scheduling**: Reminders are lost if Logseq is closed/restarted (rescanned on startup)

### Browser Compatibility

- **Desktop notifications**: Requires modern browser with Notification API support
- **Fallback behavior**: If desktop notifications fail, in-app messages still work
- **Permission handling**: Automatically requests notification permission on first load

### Performance Considerations

- **Database queries**: Scans all blocks with "SCHEDULED:" or `scheduled` properties
- **Memory usage**: Stores upcoming reminders in memory (limited to 7 days)
- **Query frequency**: Default 30-second polling interval balances responsiveness vs. performance
- **Large graphs**: May be slower on very large Logseq graphs (>10,000 blocks)

### Troubleshooting

#### No notifications appearing
1. Check browser notification permissions (click browser's lock icon)
2. Verify block has time component: `14:30` not just `<2025-10-14>`
3. Check console for error messages
4. Try manual rescan: `/reminders: rescan`

#### Duplicate notifications
- Plugin tracks notifications to prevent duplicates
- Restarting Logseq may cause one duplicate (will be prevented thereafter)
- Check "Already Notified" in settings (internal storage)

#### Performance issues
- Reduce check interval in settings (increase seconds)
- Change daily rescan to off-peak hours
- Contact support for very large graphs (>50,000 blocks)
