# üö® EMERGENCY DEBUGGING VERSION v1.2.2

## What I Changed to Fix ALL Issues:

### 1. ‚ùå **NO MORE SETTINGS AT ALL**
- Removed ALL settings from package.json
- Plugin should appear in list but have NO settings button  
- This eliminates XCode crashes completely

### 2. ‚ùå **NO MORE PAST EVENT NOTIFICATIONS**
- Changed from "1 hour ago cutoff" to "NO PAST EVENTS AT ALL"
- Any reminder older than RIGHT NOW will be blocked
- This should completely stop the 7:05 AM notifications

### 3. ‚ùå **HARDCODED VALUES**
- Lead time: 0 minutes (hardcoded)
- Check interval: 30 seconds (hardcoded)
- All-day reminders: DISABLED (hardcoded)
- No dependency on logseq.settings

### 4. ‚ùå **ENHANCED DEBUG OUTPUT**
- Plugin will show "v1.2.2-BUGFIX" in console
- Shows exact times being compared
- Shows when past events are blocked

## üß™ Testing This Version:

1. **Reload Plugin**:
   ```
   Logseq Settings ‚Üí Plugins ‚Üí Find "Reminder Notifications" ‚Üí Reload
   ```

2. **Check Plugin List**:
   - Plugin should appear in the list
   - Should NOT have a settings button/gear icon
   - No XCode should open

3. **Check Console**:
   - Look for: "v1.2.2-BUGFIX starting..."
   - Look for debug times showing past events being blocked

4. **Test New Reminder**:
   ```
   SCHEDULED: <2025-10-14 Mon 17:00> Test for later today
   ```

5. **Verify Old Reminders Blocked**:
   - Should see in console: "isPast=true" for 7:05 AM event
   - Should NOT get any notifications for 7:05 AM

## üéØ Expected Results:

- ‚úÖ **NO XCode crashes** (no settings to open)
- ‚úÖ **NO 7:05 AM notifications** (all past events blocked)  
- ‚úÖ **Plugin appears in list** (basic functionality works)
- ‚úÖ **Future reminders work** (only notifications for upcoming events)

## If This Works:

Then we know the issues were:
1. Settings schema causing XCode crashes
2. Past event filtering not aggressive enough  
3. Persistent storage conflicts

We can then gradually add back features with proper implementation.

## If This Still Fails:

Then there's a deeper issue with:
1. Plugin loading/caching
2. Logseq plugin system conflicts
3. File permissions or installation problems

Let me know the results and I'll adjust accordingly!
